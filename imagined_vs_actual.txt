EEG MOTOR IMAGERY VISUALIZATION SUMMARY - Subject S001
================================================================================

IMAGE 1: TEMPORAL DYNAMICS (04_temporal_dynamics.png)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PURPOSE: Shows how brain wave power changes across three time phases of movement

THREE TIME WINDOWS:
  • Pre-movement (-0.5 to 0s): Baseline resting state before cue
  • Early movement (0 to 1s): Initial response after cue appears
  • Sustained movement (1 to 2s): During actual/imagined execution

KEY FINDINGS:
  • Theta dominates (55-70 μV²/Hz) and increases during movement in both conditions
  • Alpha suppression visible: drops from ~30-33 to ~30-32 μV²/Hz (ERD onset)
  • Beta shows different patterns:
    - Actual movement: Initial drop (10.5→9.9) then rebound to 11.9 (PMBR effect)
    - Imagined movement: Gradual increase (8.8→9.6→10.3)
  • Pre-movement phase nearly identical between actual/imagined (no cue yet)
  • Biggest divergence in sustained phase due to proprioceptive feedback

INTERPRETATION: Motor imagery follows similar temporal evolution as actual 
movement, with ERD developing within 200ms and persisting throughout task.

================================================================================

IMAGE 2: MOVEMENT COMPLEXITY (03_complexity_analysis.png)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PURPOSE: Compares single limb vs dual limb movements to assess complexity effects

BETA POWER COMPARISON:
  • Actual movement: Single=10.87, Dual=11.71 μV²/Hz (p=0.0282, significant!)
  • Imagined movement: Single=9.71, Dual=10.23 μV²/Hz (not significant)
  • Dual limb movements show 7.7% higher beta during actual execution
  • Complexity difference diminishes during imagery

INTER-HEMISPHERIC COHERENCE:
  • High baseline coherence (0.6-0.8) across all frequencies
  • Minimal difference between single and dual limb conditions
  • Peak coherence around 5-10 Hz (alpha/theta band)
  • Both hemispheres coordinate even for unilateral movements

INTERPRETATION: Complex movements require modestly more neural resources 
(beta power) during execution, but motor control is fundamentally bilateral 
regardless of task complexity.

================================================================================

IMAGE 3: LATERALIZATION ANALYSIS (02_lateralization_analysis.png)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PURPOSE: Demonstrates brain's cross-wiring (left brain controls right hand)

C3 CHANNEL (Left Motor Cortex):
  • Right fist movement shows larger amplitude than left fist
  • Pattern preserved in both actual and imagined conditions
  • Evidence of contralateral control

C4 CHANNEL (Right Motor Cortex):
  • Left fist movement shows larger amplitude than right fist
  • Confirms cross-wiring principle
  • Noisier in imagined condition but pattern persists

LATERALIZATION INDEX:
  • Actual movement: Clear separation visible 200-1000ms post-cue
  • Imagined movement: Weaker but present lateralization
  • Positive index = left brain active (right hand moving)
  • Negative index = right brain active (left hand moving)

INTERPRETATION: Motor imagery maintains spatial specificity and anatomical 
organization of motor planning circuits. This enables BCIs to distinguish 
WHICH limb is being imagined, not just THAT movement is imagined.

================================================================================

IMAGE 4: OVERVIEW COMPARISON (01_overview_comparison.png)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PURPOSE: Comprehensive summary comparing actual vs imagined movements

POWER SPECTRUM (Top Left):
  • Blue line (actual) and purple line (imagined) nearly overlap
  • Demonstrates functional equivalence of imagery and execution
  • Includes baseline conditions: eyes-open and eyes-closed
  • Eyes-closed alpha is 4.2x higher than eyes-open (Berger effect)

CHANNEL AMPLITUDE (Top Right):
  • C3: 52.6 actual vs 50.0 imagined (4.9% difference)
  • C4: 47.2 actual vs 42.2 imagined (10.6% difference)  
  • Cz: 55.4 actual vs 52.3 imagined (5.6% difference)
  • Consistent amplitudes confirm robust motor imagery

TIME-FREQUENCY HEATMAPS (Middle):
  • Blue zones = ERD (brain waves suppressed during movement)
  • Strong blue in 10-20 Hz range after cue onset (t=0)
  • Pattern appears in BOTH actual and imagined conditions
  • Single limb vs dual limb show similar ERD patterns

STATISTICAL TABLE (Bottom):
  • Theta: 71.37 actual vs 71.15 imagined (p=0.9411, not significant)
  • Alpha: 34.14 actual vs 31.73 imagined (p=0.2096, not significant)
  • Beta: 11.29 actual vs 9.97 imagined (p=0.0039, SIGNIFICANT**)
  • Baseline eyes-closed alpha = 133.37 vs eyes-open = 31.82 μV²/Hz

INTERPRETATION: Motor imagery produces nearly identical neural patterns to 
actual movement. Only beta band shows significant difference, likely reflecting
proprioceptive feedback and actual muscle commands absent in imagery.

================================================================================
OVERALL CONCLUSIONS
================================================================================

1. FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENCE: 3% overall difference between actual and imagined 
   movement demonstrates motor imagery activates the same planning circuits

2. PRESERVED LATERALIZATION: Cross-wiring maintained in imagery enables 
   specific limb discrimination for BCI applications

3. COMPLEXITY EFFECTS: Dual limb movements require 7.7% more beta power, 
   but hemispheric coordination remains high regardless of complexity

4. RAPID ONSET: ERD develops within 200ms of cue, with peak at 1-2 seconds

5. BASELINE MATTERS: Eyes-closed alpha 4.2x higher than eyes-open highlights 
   critical importance of appropriate baseline selection

APPLICATIONS: Brain-computer interfaces, stroke rehabilitation, sports 
performance training, and clinical motor disorder diagnostics

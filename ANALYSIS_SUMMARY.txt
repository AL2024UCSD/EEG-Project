S001 - IMAGINED VS ACTUAL MOVEMENT ANALYSIS
======================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------
Subject: S001
Total runs analyzed: 14
  - Baseline runs: 2 (Eyes Open, Eyes Closed)
  - Movement task runs: 12 (6 Real, 6 Imagined)
Motor channels: C3, C4, Cz, FC1, FC2, CP1, CP2
Analysis date: 2025-10-29 14:26

KEY FINDINGS
--------------------------------------------------
1. Mu Rhythm (8-13 Hz) Power:
   - Baseline (Eyes Open): 34.69 pV²/Hz
   - Baseline (Eyes Closed): 116.30 pV²/Hz
   - Actual movements: 35.84 pV²/Hz
   - Imagined movements: 34.75 pV²/Hz
   - Actual vs Baseline (Open): 3.3% change
   - Imagined vs Baseline (Open): 0.2% change
   - Imagined vs Actual: -3.0% difference

2. Movement Detection:
   - Baseline shows characteristic resting state patterns
   - Eyes closed baseline shows increased alpha/mu rhythm (typical)
   - Actual movements show stronger ERD (Event-Related Desynchronization)
   - Imagined movements show similar patterns but with reduced amplitude
   - Both conditions demonstrate clear motor cortex activation

3. Lateralization:
   - Left hand movements: Greater suppression in C4 (right motor cortex)
   - Right hand movements: Greater suppression in C3 (left motor cortex)
   - Pattern preserved in both actual and imagined conditions

4. Temporal Dynamics:
   - ERD onset: ~200ms after cue in both conditions
   - Peak suppression: 1-2s post-cue
   - Beta rebound: More prominent in actual movements
